# Sprint4_T1_Spring_Postman

- Postman exercise

This is about testing the previous projects from Postman.

Create two environments:

- [x] Maven Project
- [x] Gradle project

Both environments will have two variables:

- [x] Server, which in both cases will have the value http://localhost. We set Server as global variable instead.
- [x] Port, which in the case of the Maven project will have the value 9000, and in the case of the Gradle project, 9001.

What do you have to deliver? (4 files):

- [x] The two environments exported.
- [x] A screenshot for each environment, showing the execution from Postman using the environment and the variables defined in them.
- [x] You can try the URL: http://localhost:xxxx/HelloWorld/elmeunom, or any other URL supported by both projects. (remember that for the execution to work correctly, you will need to have both projects running in Eclipse).

Run from Eclipse the projects created in the previous two levels, and show the return obtained in each project, when you call some of the available requests, using the created environments and their variables.

You will have to deliver two screenshots, one for the execution of each environment, and two files in JSON format, with the exported environments.

Very important

In addition to the Git link for the solved assignment, you must include at least two different links to the resources we have provided on campus that have or could have helped you solve the entire assignment or some parts
